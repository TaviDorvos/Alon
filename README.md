<b>Built with:</b>
- [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)
<br>
<b>Alon is a search engine and It's one of my personal projects.</b>
<br>
<b>**I'm still working on it**</b>

## Motivation
This project was supposed to be a 'Google clone', but after I've started creating it, I wondered 'Why wouldn't I do my own search engine?'.
<br>
And that's how I came to create this project.

## How to use?
1. Download or clone this repo.
2. Update your COMPOSER using `composer update`.
3. Update you `.env` file and connect the project to a new database.
4. Run all of the migrations using `php artisan migrate`.
5. Register and login in order to use the search functionality.
6. To add new articles, don't forget to change the `role` of your account from database into `admin`.
